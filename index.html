            <h3>Clint Eastwood's Movies</h3>
            <p>
               <ul>
                    <li><span class="movie_name">'A Fistful of Dollars,' 'For a Few Dollars More,' 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'</span>: in the 1960s, Eastwood traveled to Italy to star in a trio of Westerns directed by Sergio Leone. The role Eastwood took—the cool, laconic "Man with No Name"—had been turned down by James Coburn and Charles Bronson. The trio of films included 1964's A Fistful of Dollars (a remake of the Akira Kurosawa classic Yojimbo), For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). Nicknamed "spaghetti Westerns" due to their Italian production, these films gained worldwide popularity, and Eastwood became internationally known.</li>
                    <li><span class="movie_name">'Hang 'Em High'</span>: Back in the United States, Eastwood set up his own production company, Malpaso, and again took on the role of a tough-guy cowboy with Hang 'Em High (1968). Though he would quickly branch out into other genres and filmmaking roles, Eastwood would be involved with numerous popular Westerns, including High Plains Drifter (1973), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and Pale Rider (1985). </li>
                    <li><span class="movie_name">'Play Misty for Me,' 'Dirty Harry'</span>: In 1971, Eastwood starred in his directing debut, Play Misty for Me, which generated favorable reviews. Also that year, he took on the character of Harry Callahan, a contentious San Francisco cop, for Dirty Harry. The gritty, violent film proved immensely popular with the public, eventually spawning the sequels Magnum Force (1973), The Enforcer (1976), Sudden Impact (1983) and The Dead Pool (1988).</li>
                    <li><span class="movie_name">'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot'</span>: During this period, Eastwood also took detours into comedic roles, headlining Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974), alongside Jeff Bridges, and Every Which Way but Loose (1978), alongside an orangutan. In a more serious and notable appearance, he also portrayed real-life convict Frank Lee Morris in Escape from Alcatraz (1979). </li>
                    <li><span class="movie_name">'Million Dollar Baby'</span>: In 2004, Eastwood delivered another signature achievement with Million Dollar Baby, starring as an aging boxing trainer. The powerful film cleaned up on the awards circuit, earning Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards for Eastwood, as well as Oscars for actors Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. </li>
